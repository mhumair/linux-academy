## Creating Users 

```console
humair@ems:~$ sudo useradd -m -d /opt/joe joe
```

```console
humair@ems:~$ sudo useradd -m -d /opt/alice -s /bin/sh joe
```

-m : The -m tag specifies the creation of a home directory if it dosen't exist.
-d : Specifies the login directory by appending the Base directory with the user's name 
-s : Can be used to change the default login shell.

## Managing Users in Groups

### Creating a Secondary Group
```console
humair@ems:~$ sudo groupadd friends; sudo gpasswd -M alice, jhon friends
```
-M : Specifes that a list of users are to be added to the group.

### Creating a File

```console
humair@ems:~$ touch some_file
```
### Changing Group OwnerShip
```console
humair@ems:~$ chgrp some_file friends
```
### Changing Accessiblity 
```console
humair@ems:~$ setfacl -m u:alice:r-- ./some_file
```
### Changing The Shell 

Since I had already used to the `-s` flag while creating the user. I edited the etc/passwd file directly.


### Restricting Sudo Access
Since I had already used to the `-s` flag while creating the user. I edited the etc/passwd file directly.
```console
humair@ems:~$ setfacl -m u:alice:r-- ./some_file
```
For some reason the bits were'nt working here.

### /bin/false vs /usr/bin/false

The main diffrence that i found was that `bin/false` is just a binary that dosen't return anything & restricts login while `/nologin` exits gracefully with a message.


### Cloud Vs Shared Hosting


![Cloud vs Shared Hosting](https://www.hostingadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/server-comparison.jpg)

Factors  | Cloud Hosting | Managed Hosting
-------- | --------------| ----------------|
Server Resources, Configuration, and Management|Shared | Dedicated
Scalability | Easily Scale Up or Down | Scaling Requires more time
Performance | Customized Configurations Leads To Better Performance | Slows down once server is maxed out.
Security | Managed Partially By Provider | Managed By Client At the Application level
Cost | Starts from $15 to $20 | Starts from only a few Dolllars

## Cloudways Managed Services

### SSH

Secure Shell is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH. 
You can login to any shell using ssh on linux in the following way :

```console
humair@ems:~$ sudo ssh yourusername@yourip
```

### DDOS
In computing, a denial-of-service attack is a cyber-attack in which the penetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.
Six steps to prevent DDoS attacks :
* Buy more bandwidth. ...
* Build redundancy into your infrastructure. ...
* Configure your network hardware against DDoS attacks. ...
* Deploy anti-DDoS hardware and software modules. ...
* Deploy a DDoS protection appliance. ...
* Protect your DNS servers.
