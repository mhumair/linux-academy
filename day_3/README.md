## Creating Users 

```console
humair@ems:~$ sudo useradd -m -d /opt/joe joe
```

```console
humair@ems:~$ sudo useradd -m -d /opt/alice -s /bin/sh joe
```

-m : The -m tag specifies the creation of a home directory if it dosen't exist.
-d : Specifies the login directory by appending the Base directory with the user's name 
-s : Can be used to change the default login shell.

### Creating a Secondary Group
```console
humair@ems:~$ sudo groupadd friends; sudo gpasswd -M alice, jhon friends
```
-M : Specifes that a list of users are to be added to the group.

### Creating a File

```console
humair@ems:~$ touch some_file
```
### Changing Group OwnerShip
```console
humair@ems:~$ chgrp some_file friends
```
### Changing Accessiblity 
```console
humair@ems:~$ setfacl -m u:alice:r-- ./some_file
```
For some reason the bits were'nt working here.

### /bin/false vs /usr/bin/false

The main diffrence that i found was that `bin/false` is just a binary that dosen't return anything & restricts login while `/nologin` exits gracefully with a message.

### Changing The Shell 

Since I had already used to the `-s` flag while creating the user. I edited the etc/passwd file directly.

### Restricting Sudo Access
Edited the sudoers file 
```console
alice ALL=(root) /sbin/reboot
```
### Deleting a User

```console
humair@ems:~$ deluser alice
```

### Generating public/private keys using gpg.

```console
humair@ems:~$ gpg --full-gen-key
```
![generate key gpg](https://i.ibb.co/84hQ4Wr/gpg-key-gen.png)

### Encrypting files using gpg
```console
humair@ems:~$ gpg -c ./mangpg
```
![generate key gpg](https://i.ibb.co/84hQ4Wr/gpg-key-gen.png)
### Generating public/private ssh key pairs.
```console
humair@ems:~$ gpg -c ./mangpg
```
### Configuring SSH Server For Remote Access.
```console
humair@ems:~$ ssh localhost
```

The command for connecting to the remote & this server was also fairly the same. However do we need to portforward in order for it to work on different network machines?

### Configuring telnet for Remote Access.

```console
humair@ems:~$ telnet
```
![localhost telnet](https://i.ibb.co/9GzWvVz/telnet.png)
